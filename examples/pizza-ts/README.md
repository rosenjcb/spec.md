# pizza-ts

A small, dependency-light reference example for the **spec.md** standard.

It implements a pizza ordering API directly from a single OKF spec —
[`specs/order.spec.md`](specs/order.spec.md) — and shows how the spec's
Functional Requirements (FR-*) and QA Test Cases (TC-*) trace into code, unit
tests, and live HTTP integration requests.

> Only `specs/order.spec.md` follows the OKF/spec.md format. The READMEs here
> are ordinary developer docs.

## Stack

- **TypeScript** (ESM, strict)
- **Express 4** — the HTTP server
- **Vitest** — unit + HTTP-level tests
- **tsx** — run TypeScript directly, no build step
- **httpyac** / IntelliJ `.http` — integration requests in [`http/`](http/)

```

The domain lives in its own folder, `src/orders/`, while `src/app.ts` is the
HTTP adapter that sits outside it. That lets the spec's `sources` field show
both a **folder** reference (`../src/orders`) and an **individual file**
reference (`../src/app.ts`). The `tests` field does the same — a folder
(`../test/orders`) plus a single file (`../http/orders.http`).

## Getting started

```bash
cd examples/pizza-ts
npm install

npm run start        # serve on http://localhost:3000
npm test             # run the vitest suites
npm run build        # type-check only (tsc --noEmit)
```

## API

| Method | Path          | Description                          | Spec |
|--------|---------------|--------------------------------------|------|
| GET    | `/health`     | Liveness probe                       | —    |
| GET    | `/menu`       | List pizzas and base prices          | FR-2 |
| POST   | `/orders`     | Create an order from a request       | FR-1, FR-2, FR-4 |
| GET    | `/orders/:id` | Fetch a previously created order     | FR-5 |

Prices are in **whole cents**. Size multipliers: `small` ×1, `medium` ×1.3,
`large` ×1.6 (rounded to the nearest cent).

### Example

```bash
curl -s localhost:3000/orders \
  -H 'content-type: application/json' \
  -d '{"customerId":"cust-1","items":[{"pizzaId":"pepperoni","size":"large","quantity":2}]}'
```

## Integration tests

The [`http/`](http/) folder holds `.http` requests runnable from IntelliJ or
httpyac, with assertions tied to the spec's QA Test Cases. See
[`http/README.md`](http/README.md).

## How this maps to the spec

The spec's metadata splits the system into two relative-path fields, each
mixing a folder reference with an individual file:

- `sources` → `../src/orders, ../src/app.ts` — the orders domain folder plus the
  HTTP adapter file that enforce the requirements.
- `tests` → `../test/orders, ../http/orders.http` — the orders test suite folder
  plus the `.http` integration requests that prove them.

Both are relative to `specs/order.spec.md` and are optional, but here they keep
the spec wired to both the code and its verification.

Every requirement and test case in [`specs/order.spec.md`](specs/order.spec.md)
has a home in the code. A requirement is higher-level than a single check, so
one `FR` can own several `TC`s:

- **FR-1** (TC-1) → `OrderStore.create` + `POST /orders`
- **FR-2** (TC-2, TC-3, TC-4) → `unitPriceFor`, `SIZE_MULTIPLIER`, total computation
- **FR-3** (TC-5) → `structuredClone` on store read/write (immutability)
- **FR-4** (TC-6, TC-7, TC-8) → validation in `priceItem` / `OrderStore.create`
- **FR-5** (TC-9) → `OrderStore.get` + `GET /orders/:id`

## Review & sign-off

The spec also demonstrates the [review convention](../../REVIEW.md). Its
frontmatter declares the DACI roles (`driver`, `approvers`, `contributors`,
`informed`), a `status`, and a `review` key pointing at the review record —
which lives right next to the spec, like `sources` and `tests`.

[`specs/order.review.md`](specs/order.review.md) holds two rounds: a kickoff
`notice` sent while the spec was only Intro and Scope, and the pre-build
`signoff` that flipped the spec to `status: approved`. Note what the record
does *not* contain: no requirements, no scope, no behavior. Each round links
to the spec at a version, names who was asked for what, and lists changes
since the prior round by `FR-N`/`TC-N` ID only.

In CI, `spec-md check --require-approved` turns the lifecycle into a merge
gate: a spec riding a feature branch as `in-review` fails the check until
its review concludes and the status flips to `approved`.
